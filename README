IMAGE INTEGRITY VERIFIER.
*************************

Installation 
Run the bash script install. IMPORTANT: The SGX SDK utility must be installed in /opt/intel/

Initialization.
-------------------------
IIVR supports two modes:

1. Complete: The SGX enclave and Python-C-wrapper are both compiled. This requires a file with a list of images, to be kept in trusted memory, to be provided. (Every time this is compiled a enclave sealed key is provided).

2.Fast: This does compile neither the SGX enclave nor the python-C-wrapper. Assuming the attester has an already sealed hash file ( This must be sealed using the same material as the enclave seal key) The IIVR runs and read the "trusted" from that list.

For more information please use the option -h.
